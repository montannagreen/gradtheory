# Cloud Computing - Concepts, Architecture and Challenges
#### Yashpalsinh Jadeja, Kitrit Modi

Designed as a computing environment where computing needs by one party can be outsources to another party and when need be, arise to use the computing power or resources like database or emails, they can access them via internet. 

Moves computing and data away from desktop and portable PCs into large data centres.

Advantage of cloud computing is that customers do not have to pay for infrasturure, its installation, required man power to handle such infrastucture and maintenance. 

Cloud computing deals with computation, software, data acess and software services that may not require end-user knowledge of the physical location and the configuration of the system that is delivering the services.

Main goal of cloud computing is to make a better use of distributed resources, combine them to achieve higher throughput and be able to solve large scale computation problems. Cloud computing deals with virtualisation, scalability, interoperability, quality of service and the delivery models of the cloud, namely private, public and hybrid. 

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing 
Users access the data, applications or any other services with the help of a browser regardless of the device used and the user's location. 
Less IT skills are required for implementation 
Sharing of resources and costs amongst a large collection of users allows efficient utilization of the infrastructure.
Maintenance is easier in case of cloud computing applications as they need not to be installed on each users computer.

### Architecture
Divided into two sections: front end and back end.
Front end is what the client (user) sees whereas the back end is the cloud of the system. 
Front end has the clinets computer and the application required to access the cloud and the back has the cloud computing services like various computers, servers and data storage. 

### Advantages
The maintenance of the infrastructure, be it hardware or software is simplified, thus, less headaches for the IT team. Also applications that are quite storage extensive are more easier to use in the cloud environment compared to the same when used by the organization by its own. Also at the user level, what you mostly need is a simple web browser with internet connectivity.

### Disadvantages
The biggest concerns about cloud computing are security and privacy.
One way to solve this issue is the use of proper authentication techniques. Another solution is to provide with an authorization - so that each user can access only the data and applications relevant to his or her job.
Reliability is an issue. Servers in the cloud can have the same problems as the organization's resident servers. Downtimes can occur with cloud servers too.
