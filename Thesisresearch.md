# Cloud Computing - Concepts, Architecture and Challenges
#### Yashpalsinh Jadeja, Kitrit Modi

Designed as a computing environment where computing needs by one party can be outsources to another party and when need be, arise to use the computing power or resources like database or emails, they can access them via internet. 

Moves computing and data away from desktop and portable PCs into large data centres.

Advantage of cloud computing is that customers do not have to pay for infrasturure, its installation, required man power to handle such infrastucture and maintenance. 

Cloud computing deals with computation, software, data acess and software services that may not require end-user knowledge of the physical location and the configuration of the system that is delivering the services.

Main goal of cloud computing is to make a better use of distributed resources, combine them to achieve higher throughput and be able to solve large scale computation problems. Cloud computing deals with virtualisation, scalability, interoperability, quality of service and the delivery models of the cloud, namely private, public and hybrid. 

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing 
Users access the data, applications or any other services with the help of a browser regardless of the device used and the user's location. 
Less IT skills are required for implementation 
Sharing of resources and costs amongst a large collection of users allows efficient utilization of the infrastructure.
Maintenance is easier in case of cloud computing applications as they need not to be installed on each users computer.

### Architecture
Divided into two sections: front end and back end.
Front end is what the client (user) sees whereas the back end is the cloud of the system. 
Front end has the clinets computer and the application required to access the cloud and the back has the cloud computing services like various computers, servers and data storage. 

### Advantages
The maintenance of the infrastructure, be it hardware or software is simplified, thus, less headaches for the IT team. Also applications that are quite storage extensive are more easier to use in the cloud environment compared to the same when used by the organization by its own. Also at the user level, what you mostly need is a simple web browser with internet connectivity.

### Disadvantages
The biggest concerns about cloud computing are security and privacy.
One way to solve this issue is the use of proper authentication techniques. Another solution is to provide with an authorization - so that each user can access only the data and applications relevant to his or her job.
Reliability is an issue. Servers in the cloud can have the same problems as the organization's resident servers. Downtimes can occur with cloud servers too.


# Cloud Computing: Issues and Challenges
#### Tharam Dillon, Chen Wu and Elizabeth Chang
### Definition
U.S. NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) appears to include key common elements widely used in the Cloud Computing community: Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, ondemand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

In particular, five essential elements of cloud computing are clearly articulated:

On-demand self-service: A consumer with an instantaneous need at a particular timeslot can avail computing resources (such as CPU time, network storage, software use, and so forth) in an automatic (i.e. convenient, self-serve) fashion without resorting to human interactions with providers of these resources.

Broad network access: These computing resources are delivered over the network (e.g. Internet) and used by various client applications with heterogeneous platforms (such as mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs) situated at a consumer's site.

Resource pooling. A cloud service provider’s computing resources are 'pooled' together in an effort to serve multiple consumers using either the multi-tenancy or the virtualization model, "with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand" [1]. The motivation for setting up such a pool-based computing paradigm lies in two important factors: economies of scale and specialization. The result of a pool-based model is that physical computing resources become 'invisible' to consumers, who in general do not have control or knowledge over the location, formation, and originalities of these resources (e.g. database, CPU, etc.) . For example, consumers are not able to tell where their data is going to be stored in the Cloud.

Rapid elasticity. For consumers, computing resources become immediate rather than persistent: there are no up-front commitment and contract as they can use them to scale up whenever they want, and release them once they finish to scale down. Moreover, resources provisioning appears to be infinite to them, the consumption can rapidly rise in order to meet peak requirement at any time.

Measured Service. Although computing resources are pooled and shared by multiple consumers (i.e. multi-tenancy), the cloud infrastructure is able to use appropriate mechanisms to measure the usage of these resources for each individual consumer through its metering capabilities.


### Service Model

Software as a Service (Saas). - cloud consumers release their applications on a hosting environment, which can be accessed through networks from various clients by application users. Cloud consumers do not have control over the cloud infrasturcture that ofetn employs a multi-tenancy system architecture, nameling, different cloud consumers applicationsare organised in a single logical enviornment on the SaaS cloud.

Platform as a Service (PaaS). is a development platform suppirting the full 'software lifecyle' which allows cloud consumers o develop cloud services and applications direections onto the Paas cloud. Holds both developing and developed applications.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). -Cloud consumers directly use IT infrasturtures (processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources) provided in the IaaS cloud. Virtualisation is extensively used in IaaS cloud in order to integrate/decompose physical resources in an as-hoc manner to meet growing or shrinking resource demand from sloud consumers.

Data as a Service (Daas). The delivery of virtualized storage on demand becomes a seperate Cloud service - data storafe service. DaaS allows consumers to pay for what they are actualling sig rather than the site license for the entire database. 


# An experimental study on collaborative effectiveness of augmented reality petentials in urban design
#### Xiangyu Wang, Rui Chen

The traditional design process employs a sequence of paper-based activities: site visits and drawing, measuring with printout, sketching or design ideas, and deign finalisation in computer-aided design (CAD) systems. This process has proved to be an effectice design approach in siutations where there is a signle designer. 

For collaborative design activites, however, effective communication is a challenge, considering that paper-based media such as hand drawings are difficult to understand for certain stakeholders (e.g. clients) other than designers.

Effective collaboration is difficult to achieve without an approproate visualisation platform.

As an emerging cutting-edge visualisation technology, Augmented Reality, the addition of virtual entities into the real-world view, is envisaged to be a promosing visualisation platform to support design assessment and collaboration within design terms. 

What distinguishes the work presented in this paper from others is the integration of augmentation concepts (augmented reality, intelligent agents, and tangible interface) into one single collaborative tool for urban designers – Augmented Realitybased Urban Designer (ARUDesigner).

The ARUDesigner framework allows designers to manipulate objects in a proposed virtual urban area and assess the environmental impact of alternative design solutions through agent-based simulations.

Computing unit: a cluster of networked CPUs is expected to make the system overall performance viable for multi-users’ real-time interactions. Changes to the virtual urban design made by any individual designer would be constantly relayed to the central server. The central server would then send these changes to all the other designers for scene updating and synchronisation in a real-time manner.

The list of functions changes according to the context in which the menu is used. For instance, switching between AR and VR modes can be realised by the context menu. In the AR mode, designers select and move virtual objects using their data gloves. Touching a virtual building with an out-stretched finger will select it and it can then be ‘grabbed’ in a similar manner to grabbing a physical object in a real environment.

The ARUDesigner system is devised to reduce the possibility of misinterpretations among team members by providing more detailed visual information on design objects. This system also aims to encourage group collaboration and communication in order to improve the overall efficiency and productivity of design teams.

This system could allow designers to assess virtual urban designs in a real, natural, and familiar workspace.


# Combining AR and BIM
#### Fabian Danker, Oliver Jones

Coates (2010) reported that there are current limitations of BIM, including a lack of integrating with contextual information, real world capture and feedback.
Wang et al (2012) identifies that a merging of both AR and BIM technologies will address shortcomings of current onsite BIM construction which separate physical information from virtual information.
The applications curretnly considered the most valuable to industry and practitoners is the improvement of communication between architect, contractor and sub-contractor and the ability to view composite visualisations of BIM on site located within the actual context allowing greater testing and refining of design prototypes.

Currently one of the advantages of utilising BIM is its capacity to enable the different disciplines involved with a project to communicate using the same model, thereby reducing fragmentation and identifying and addressing any problems which may arise prior to construction; advantages that ultimately improve the cost, time and quality of the finished product. These advantages are characteristically synergistic with those offered when adopting AR technologies.

Wang et al (2013) have also investigated the potential of AR and BIM. Their study investigates BIM, AR tracking and AR visualisation using past literature to make logical assumptions of the types of tasks within the construction industry that could benefit from AR. Their study focused heavily on the process of information searching, and potential time saved through the adoption of AR.

According to Rankohi (2013) AEC and FM have a highdemand for information needed to enable evaluation,communication, collaboration which is utilised through information technology. The adoption of AR has clear efficiency benefits with regards to accessing information in a more timely and useful way. This is supported by Dong and Kamat (2013) who state that AR will improve visualisation, information retrieval and interaction for AEC and FM within construction.

The expert panel also reported that the manner in which BIM is currently used in industry creates a disconnection between the virtual model and real context. The use of AR combined with BIM would allow virtual data to be superimposed onto the current context on site.

Advances in onsite construction mean that contextualising virtual data in this manner would have many benefits toward a project with advances in onsite construction. As identified by Wang et al (2012) the current disconnection between BIM and its context must be improved. Participants recognise the disconnect between the virtual data and the context, as well as the potential for visualising data from the construction sequence, and potential improvements in collaboration between different disciplines on a project.

identified an increasingly problematic generation gap within the industry between digital immigrants and digital natives.This generation gap and differing attitude is problematic as the expert panel members recount numerous issues of the younger digital native being restricted from implementing new technologies and new technology centric working practices despite the potential benefits because those in charge are somewhat technology averse digital immigrants. A recurring implication to the adoption and integration of new technologies in the construction industry is the generational divide in attitudes towards those new technologies. With the digital immigrants often acting as a barrier to adoption and integration.

The expert panel viewed these technologies as being accessible through cloud based systems, which both store and process and synthesise all building data from concept, design, development, construction, maintenance, refurbishment and demolition.
