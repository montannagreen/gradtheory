# Cloud Computing - Concepts, Architecture and Challenges
#### Yashpalsinh Jadeja, Kitrit Modi

Designed as a computing environment where computing needs by one party can be outsources to another party and when need be, arise to use the computing power or resources like database or emails, they can access them via internet. 

Moves computing and data away from desktop and portable PCs into large data centres.

Advantage of cloud computing is that customers do not have to pay for infrasturure, its installation, required man power to handle such infrastucture and maintenance. 

Cloud computing deals with computation, software, data acess and software services that may not require end-user knowledge of the physical location and the configuration of the system that is delivering the services.

Main goal of cloud computing is to make a better use of distributed resources, combine them to achieve higher throughput and be able to solve large scale computation problems. Cloud computing deals with virtualisation, scalability, interoperability, quality of service and the delivery models of the cloud, namely private, public and hybrid. 

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing 
Users access the data, applications or any other services with the help of a browser regardless of the device used and the user's location. 
Less IT skills are required for implementation 
Sharing of resources and costs amongst a large collection of users allows efficient utilization of the infrastructure.
Maintenance is easier in case of cloud computing applications as they need not to be installed on each users computer.

### Architecture
Divided into two sections: front end and back end.
Front end is what the client (user) sees whereas the back end is the cloud of the system. 
Front end has the clinets computer and the application required to access the cloud and the back has the cloud computing services like various computers, servers and data storage. 

### Advantages
The maintenance of the infrastructure, be it hardware or software is simplified, thus, less headaches for the IT team. Also applications that are quite storage extensive are more easier to use in the cloud environment compared to the same when used by the organization by its own. Also at the user level, what you mostly need is a simple web browser with internet connectivity.

### Disadvantages
The biggest concerns about cloud computing are security and privacy.
One way to solve this issue is the use of proper authentication techniques. Another solution is to provide with an authorization - so that each user can access only the data and applications relevant to his or her job.
Reliability is an issue. Servers in the cloud can have the same problems as the organization's resident servers. Downtimes can occur with cloud servers too.


# Cloud Computing: Issues and Challenges
#### Tharam Dillon, Chen Wu and Elizabeth Chang
### Definition
U.S. NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) appears to include key common elements widely used in the Cloud Computing community: Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, ondemand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

In particular, five essential elements of cloud computing are clearly articulated:

On-demand self-service: A consumer with an instantaneous need at a particular timeslot can avail computing resources (such as CPU time, network storage, software use, and so forth) in an automatic (i.e. convenient, self-serve) fashion without resorting to human interactions with providers of these resources.

Broad network access: These computing resources are delivered over the network (e.g. Internet) and used by various client applications with heterogeneous platforms (such as mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs) situated at a consumer's site.

Resource pooling. A cloud service provider’s computing resources are 'pooled' together in an effort to serve multiple consumers using either the multi-tenancy or the virtualization model, "with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand" [1]. The motivation for setting up such a pool-based computing paradigm lies in two important factors: economies of scale and specialization. The result of a pool-based model is that physical computing resources become 'invisible' to consumers, who in general do not have control or knowledge over the location, formation, and originalities of these resources (e.g. database, CPU, etc.) . For example, consumers are not able to tell where their data is going to be stored in the Cloud.

Rapid elasticity. For consumers, computing resources become immediate rather than persistent: there are no up-front commitment and contract as they can use them to scale up whenever they want, and release them once they finish to scale down. Moreover, resources provisioning appears to be infinite to them, the consumption can rapidly rise in order to meet peak requirement at any time.

Measured Service. Although computing resources are pooled and shared by multiple consumers (i.e. multi-tenancy), the cloud infrastructure is able to use appropriate mechanisms to measure the usage of these resources for each individual consumer through its metering capabilities.


### Service Model

Software as a Service (Saas). - cloud consumers release their applications on a hosting environment, which can be accessed through networks from various clients by application users. Cloud consumers do not have control over the cloud infrasturcture that ofetn employs a multi-tenancy system architecture, nameling, different cloud consumers applicationsare organised in a single logical enviornment on the SaaS cloud.

Platform as a Service (PaaS). is a development platform suppirting the full 'software lifecyle' which allows cloud consumers o develop cloud services and applications direections onto the Paas cloud. Holds both developing and developed applications.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). -Cloud consumers directly use IT infrasturtures (processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources) provided in the IaaS cloud. Virtualisation is extensively used in IaaS cloud in order to integrate/decompose physical resources in an as-hoc manner to meet growing or shrinking resource demand from sloud consumers.

Data as a Service (Daas). The delivery of virtualized storage on demand becomes a seperate Cloud service - data storafe service. DaaS allows consumers to pay for what they are actualling sig rather than the site license for the entire database. 


# An experimental study on collaborative effectiveness of augmented reality petentials in urban design
#### Xiangyu Wang, Rui Chen

The traditional design process employs a sequence of paper-based activities: site visits and drawing, measuring with printout, sketching or design ideas, and deign finalisation in computer-aided design (CAD) systems. This process has proved to be an effectice design approach in siutations where there is a signle designer. 

For collaborative design activites, however, effective communication is a challenge, considering that paper-based media such as hand drawings are difficult to understand for certain stakeholders (e.g. clients) other than designers.

Effective collaboration is difficult to achieve without an approproate visualisation platform.

As an emerging cutting-edge visualisation technology, Augmented Reality, the addition of virtual entities into the real-world view, is envisaged to be a promosing visualisation platform to support design assessment and collaboration within design terms. 

What distinguishes the work presented in this paper from others is the integration of augmentation concepts (augmented reality, intelligent agents, and tangible interface) into one single collaborative tool for urban designers – Augmented Realitybased Urban Designer (ARUDesigner).

The ARUDesigner framework allows designers to manipulate objects in a proposed virtual urban area and assess the environmental impact of alternative design solutions through agent-based simulations.

Computing unit: a cluster of networked CPUs is expected to make the system overall performance viable for multi-users’ real-time interactions. Changes to the virtual urban design made by any individual designer would be constantly relayed to the central server. The central server would then send these changes to all the other designers for scene updating and synchronisation in a real-time manner.

The list of functions changes according to the context in which the menu is used. For instance, switching between AR and VR modes can be realised by the context menu. In the AR mode, designers select and move virtual objects using their data gloves. Touching a virtual building with an out-stretched finger will select it and it can then be ‘grabbed’ in a similar manner to grabbing a physical object in a real environment.

The ARUDesigner system is devised to reduce the possibility of misinterpretations among team members by providing more detailed visual information on design objects. This system also aims to encourage group collaboration and communication in order to improve the overall efficiency and productivity of design teams.

This system could allow designers to assess virtual urban designs in a real, natural, and familiar workspace.


# Combining AR and BIM
#### Fabian Danker, Oliver Jones

Coates (2010) reported that there are current limitations of BIM, including a lack of integrating with contextual information, real world capture and feedback.
Wang et al (2012) identifies that a merging of both AR and BIM technologies will address shortcomings of current onsite BIM construction which separate physical information from virtual information.
The applications curretnly considered the most valuable to industry and practitoners is the improvement of communication between architect, contractor and sub-contractor and the ability to view composite visualisations of BIM on site located within the actual context allowing greater testing and refining of design prototypes.

Currently one of the advantages of utilising BIM is its capacity to enable the different disciplines involved with a project to communicate using the same model, thereby reducing fragmentation and identifying and addressing any problems which may arise prior to construction; advantages that ultimately improve the cost, time and quality of the finished product. These advantages are characteristically synergistic with those offered when adopting AR technologies.

Wang et al (2013) have also investigated the potential of AR and BIM. Their study investigates BIM, AR tracking and AR visualisation using past literature to make logical assumptions of the types of tasks within the construction industry that could benefit from AR. Their study focused heavily on the process of information searching, and potential time saved through the adoption of AR.

According to Rankohi (2013) AEC and FM have a highdemand for information needed to enable evaluation,communication, collaboration which is utilised through information technology. The adoption of AR has clear efficiency benefits with regards to accessing information in a more timely and useful way. This is supported by Dong and Kamat (2013) who state that AR will improve visualisation, information retrieval and interaction for AEC and FM within construction.

The expert panel also reported that the manner in which BIM is currently used in industry creates a disconnection between the virtual model and real context. The use of AR combined with BIM would allow virtual data to be superimposed onto the current context on site.

Advances in onsite construction mean that contextualising virtual data in this manner would have many benefits toward a project with advances in onsite construction. As identified by Wang et al (2012) the current disconnection between BIM and its context must be improved. Participants recognise the disconnect between the virtual data and the context, as well as the potential for visualising data from the construction sequence, and potential improvements in collaboration between different disciplines on a project.

identified an increasingly problematic generation gap within the industry between digital immigrants and digital natives.This generation gap and differing attitude is problematic as the expert panel members recount numerous issues of the younger digital native being restricted from implementing new technologies and new technology centric working practices despite the potential benefits because those in charge are somewhat technology averse digital immigrants. A recurring implication to the adoption and integration of new technologies in the construction industry is the generational divide in attitudes towards those new technologies. With the digital immigrants often acting as a barrier to adoption and integration.

The expert panel viewed these technologies as being accessible through cloud based systems, which both store and process and synthesise all building data from concept, design, development, construction, maintenance, refurbishment and demolition.


# Integrating Augmented reality with Building infomration building: onsite construction process controlling for liquefied natural gas industry
#### Xiangyu Wang, Martijn Truijens, Lei Hou, Yin Wang, Ying Zhou

Building Information Modeling (BIM) facilitates the convenient and highly-efficient multi-professional collaboration. By synchronizing the central files, various professionals are able to share the same data set and operate on a unified platform. It is noted that the technical kernel of BIM is comprised of 3D visualization and the corresponding building information management mechanisms

With AR, a person is able to combine the 3D object into the normal viewing perspective without losing any of the advantages of object movement and individual movement in real-world environments

It is envisaged that BIM + AR can fulfill these visions effectively through visualizing BIM data right into the physical context of each construction activity or task.Essentially the conventional role of AR is the visualization end. Any data fed into this end has to be pre-processed so that it makes sense to the end users.

the digital building information in BIM is subject to a lack of interaction between the virtual and real worlds, which to some extent, hinders the overall grasp of digital project information. This limits the real-time communication and integration of BIM to the site and task conditions, and the interaction of the field crew with BIM.

AR is investigated to develop solutions for a (Liquefied Natural Gas) LNG mega project to facilitate the efficiency of onsite project progress monitoring and control. AR can be used to visualize a facility in the context of the realworkspace to enable the ‘as built’ progress against ‘as planned’, since the as planned facility is right in the context of the real workspace to enable project managers, workers and other stakeholders to review the building progress. An AR system can enable the site management crew to be aware of the actual progress of a project as compared to as planned,which forms a solid basis for justifying progressive payment.

AR can be used to expedite tasks more efficiently and effectively, as information can be made readily available in real-time and real context. Enabling salient information to be available on demand, particularly during operation and maintenance phases, can improve decision-making. The use of AR should lower the frequency of switching between information resource (paper drawings or computer) andwork piece tasks by integrating the required information into activities and therefore reduce the time and energy associated with repetitive switching [37]. For many tasks, accurate performance requires not only that pertinent information be retained temporarily, but also that the information be acted on quickly


Technically, AR can insert digital information into the physical context of the workspace in a real time manner. In this paper, mobile devices such an iPad, iPhone and PC tablet are used as the platform to enable AR.


To facilitate the on-site design review process, this AR scenario enables the on-site workers to scrutinize the design by ‘walking into’ the difference levels from what is seen in Fig. 2 to what is seen in Fig. 4. The workers can zoom in and out for details and look around as well. Therefore a high level of constructability is achieved and conveyed clearly to the site via AR. The 3D reinforcement detailing reduces the periods of time usually required for alteration to drawings, saving time for all parties involved. By trusting this, the model checking time is significantly reduced. A full 3D solidmodel of concrete frame filledwith rebar was produced with AR. This amounted to detailing reinforcement using 3D models issued to the design and site teams with each drawing. A 3D color coded progress modelwas issued on aweekly basis to contractors. With AR, when a full model is created, drawings can be linked to the models so that people use the model to navigate and click on a location to find the drawings of an area. AR, used on a portable device, enables the user to click on a location in the 3D model and all the drawings related to that area.


if users want to build their own models, they must acquire the knowledge of OpenGL. For the purpose of facilitating layman users without OpenGL knowledge, some AR systems have realized the direct loading of varieties of model files, such as BuildAR and Layer. However, these systems cannot be transplanted or customized to fit mobile devise such as iPad or Tablet, thus, it was decided to re-develop a set of functionalities that can dynamically trigger the augmented models into our mobile devices by tracking the barcode and QR. Our system is prototyped using Objective C, an iOS programming language, and integrates various software development kits (SDK), e.g., mobile AR SDK, sensing/tracking SDK and real-time communication SDK. By scanning the barcode attached to each component, the system can demonstrate the menu on top, which can be customized by the users to encapsulate as much information as they want. 


The use of an assembly drawing for complex and intricate processes can contribute mental tiredness and the propensity to commit errors, as information retrieval often increases. Likewise Veinott et al. [47] revealed that 60% of errors that are committed are procedural and are due to misunderstanding the drawing. Such misunderstanding may arise due to the unilateral retrieval of information which may trigger behavioral repetition and therefore suppresses motivation. In this study, AR has been identified as a solution. This is where AR technology comes into the picture since from a cognitive psychology standpoint, it has the potential to merge the informational activity with the direct work activity to make information access more efficient. 


As an emerging technology, AR can integrate the information context such as the assembly path and fixation forms of parts/components into the real workspace


Another issue is that there exists a mismatch between the level of details for BIM and AR. BIM is a detailed multi-facet data model and AR only needs part of the data for visualization, so there might be a gap in the level of details which needs intelligence and interface to map. Future BIM should be information critical, intelligent, and context-aware in order to be better integrated with AR on site.


First of all, the BIM + AR systems are capable of identifying the interdependence, aswell as the complexity of tasks derived fromdifferent roles that mainly focus on their individual tasks in the current construction practice. Secondly, the BIM + AR systems can make the interdependencies between work tasks more explicit, and also make the existing interdependency and complexity more visible and therefore more manageable onsite. The systems integrating AR with BIM are able to display an immersive view right into the real environments where the participants stay, visualize the as planned data onto the as built environment right in place, and alleviate the mental workload undergone by the participants


# Data Transmission Opportunities for collaborative cloud-based building information modeling 
#### Kereshmeh Afsari, Charles M.Eastman, Dennis R. Shelden

investigate what features of Cloud interoperability can assist a network-based BIM data transmission for a collaborative work flow in the Architecture, Construction, and Engineering (AEC) industry. This study indicates that Cloud-BIM interoperability needs to deploy major components such as APIs, data transfer protocols, data formats, and standardization to redefine BIM data flow in the Cloud and to reshape the collaboration process.


Cloud-BIM is considered to be the second generation of BIM development and studies suggest that it will produce a major change across the industry although the technology is still relatively new. Cloud-BIM has caused a new direction in BIM implementation and development to support BIM data generation and consumption among members of the project. By applying Cloud Computing in BIM services, Building Information Modeling can achieve a higher performance with a relatively low cost. Cloud-BIM technology is believed to lead to higher levels of information interaction and provide an effective cross-disciplinary collaboration.


the main objective of this paper is to investigate what approaches and techniques of Web technologies exist that can assist with improving BIM data transmission to address a network-based data exchange for a collaborative workflow. Hence, this research underlines recent developments and opportunities to address fundamental challenges of BIM data exchange.


Previous work (Afsari et al., 2016) identified current Cloud-BIM interoperability approaches in three categories of data flow architecture. First, manual file transfer that is currently a common way of exchanging BIM data across applications. Project data can be exported and shared in the form of vendor specific formats or neutral format using IFC standard (Zhang et al., 2014). Second, BIM server technologies in which server-based BIM solutions known as model collaboration systems (Shafiq et al., 2013) have provided a central BIM service with a single-sourced data server accessible for project partners (Zhang et al., 2014; Beetz et al., 2011). These model server technologies utilize information directly from the models and are intended to improve multidisciplinary collaboration. Third, Data Interchange Hub such as Flux project (Flux, 2016) that can automate data flow between certain applications. This type of solution currently has a very limited implementation and supports very few design applications to be connected via the hub. Also, in this approach the inter-connection of applications relies on the hub solution and its capabilities although supported software packages can exchange data directly.


Information sharing is the starting point of collaboration and it requires applications to be able to exchange data regardless of vendors and data formats. To achieve this, in the AEC industry, building data is described in IFC specification to support a neutral data format and to facilitate cross-platform BIM interoperability


There are several categories of Cloud services such as infrastructure, platform, application, etc. Based on the services that the Cloud solution provides, there are three major types of Cloud computing models as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), Paas (Platform as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Service). a client includes computer software and hardware for application delivery, a Cloud application delivers SaaS, platform services or PaaS provide a computing platform using the cloud infrastructure provided by IaaS, and a server contains computer software and hardware for the delivery of Cloud services


In Cloud computing the term “interoperability” might sometimes refer to “portability” which is the ability to move a system from one cloud platform to another (Lewis, 2013; Rimal et al. 2009). Interoperability which is discussed in this research, is considered as the ability of data exchange and integration. Here, interoperability deals with what is known as “enabling products/software components to work with or integrate with each other seamlessly, in order to achieve a desired result” (Antonopoulos & Gillam, 2010). The issue is each Cloud provider incorporate Cloud computing with a self-contained set of conventions, data formats, and application programming interfaces (APIs) and in order to allow Cloud services interoperate identification of major Cloud interoperability components is critical


Common TCP/IP protocols are HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) as a protocol designed to allow the transfer of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents. World Wide Web traffic mostly uses the HTTP protocol because HTTP uses the most bandwidth across the Internet (IBM, 2006). As illustrated in Figure 3, HTTP takes care of the communication between a web server and a web browser. It first establishes a secure connection between a server and a browser. Then, a client that is running an application on the web browser can send requests to the connected server and upon request, the server sends data that reside on a repository or a datastore to the client


Two most common text-based approaches of data serialization are eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and have been used widely in Web applications for data transmission (Wang, 2011; Sumaray, and Makki, 2012). XML and JSON have different features. XML has a prescriptive grammar and stores all data in the closed tag with the data indexed by labels. JSON on the other hand is a lightweight data exchange format uses a text format independent of the language and has higher parsing efficiency than XML


current BIM collaboration and data exchange process are mainly based on manual file transfer while data request by the receiver of data (i.e. Application B illustrated in Figure 4) happens outside of an automated process with no direct control on interacting with required data. In addition, data exchange might be based on BIM integration solutions which are addressing model federation in a centralized platform or interconnecting a limited number of design applications on premise through an interchange hub with the help of plug-ins. Server-based and interchange hub solutions are mainly based on limited data formats and allow limited number of applications to interoperate. Therefore, collaboration with other applications that are not supported in the cycle of these systems will again rely on exporting/importing BIM models in the form of files.


This research specified a data flow for Cloud-BIM that utilizes true potentials of the Web technologies and can perform as an enabler for a collaborative process allowing Cloud-BIM services communicate through their standardized APIs. This data flow provides a fundamental basis for a common framework for Cloud-BIM interoperability.

Cloud-BIM interoperability research and its standardization effort is still in its infancy, and the body of knowledge in the area has not been well defined yet. Therefore, this study highlights the need for standardization of Cloud-BIM APIs using IFC data model as industry established schema.


In addition, compatible and efficient BIM data representation in the Cloud is another critical aspect in Cloud-BIM interoperability.


# A conceptual Framework for integrating building information modeling with augmented reality
#### Xiangyu Wang, Peter E.D. Love, Mi Jeong Kim, Chan-Sik Park, Chun-Pong Sing, Lei Hou

The building information model created is a digital representation of the facility's physical and functional characters. It provides a shared knowledge resource for information about the facility for a client or user to use and maintain throughout the project's life cycle

Despite the availability of high-quality graphic systems, designers (e.g., architects) predominately create digitally enhanced photographs to demonstrate the placement of a building with respect to a vantage point, or scaled physical mock-ups of building components.While this can provide a realistic insight about the proposed design and their implications in construction, it is an expensive and time-consuming process to create static structure and surface characteristics.


Wang and Dunston [28] developed a hierarchical taxonomy construction field operations that comprised the following categories (see Table 1): (1) application domain, (2) application-specific operation, (3) operation specific activity, (4) composite task, and (5) primitive tasks, to determine where construction information technology tools and methods can be applied to ameliorate task performance. 


Activities associated with composite tasks include measure, connect, navigate, organize, obtain, select, align, connect, record, and report. To acquire an object, for example, a user must move their arm and hand into position before grasping it. Primitive Tasks refer to elemental motion and include reaching, grasping, moving, and eye travel. Wang and Dunston's work [28] suggested that the primitive and composite tasks could be readily applied within an AR environment [28].


There are three mental aspects that need to be addressed when assessing the feasibility of using AR for construction related work processes [28]:
1. Information searching and accessing, which relates to how information is obtained
2. Attention allocation, which relates to the distraction from other tasks
3. Memory, which relates to sensory, short-term and long-term memory function


Spatial collision analysis (e.g., between trades) is mainly conducted in the design stage with commercial 3D modelling systems, such as Dassault Systemes CATIA® (Computer Aided Three-dimensional Interactive Application) and Autodesk® Navisworks®. However, collisions may still arise during the actual construction process due to the change orders or errors. The challenge therefore is to determine on-site real-time dynamic collision detection due to variations of construction sequence, schedule, components and methods and then provide support for a project schema demonstration. using AR, a site manager can address the potential for conflicts on-site by retrieving and visualizing all the properties and details concerning the building elements from BIM (e.g., Revit Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP)).

AR can be used to set out where the support steels or structures are to be installed from the floor above. This can potentially improve speed, safety and accuracy as well as reduce the cost of supports. For example, with AR visualization of the ‘to-be-built ductwork’, its exact location can be identified in the real spatial context, as what is visualized via AR is what needs to be built.

AR visualization of information contained within BIM can provide those on-site personnel with an improved understanding of construction sequencing, which will reduce the incidence of quality failures.


Design changes, errors and omissions, which often result in rework, are the primary factors contributing to schedule overruns [2]. Most changes from the initial design are often made during the construction and therefore will need to be recognized in the BIM. Unfortunately, at present, there is no process in place for updating the designed BIM model to incorporate the changes made during construction [39]. With this mind, it is suggested in this paper that AR can be used to map the as-built and as-planned data in a single digital environment with each component allocated with a status: ordered, procured, delivered, checked, installed, completed, commissioned, and fixed. Being able to visualize the difference between ‘as-planned and as-built’ progress enables ‘current and future’ progress to be monitored and therefore facilitates appropriate decision-making.


# A hierarchical Taxonomy of AEC operations for mixed rality applications 
#### Phillip S.Dunston, Xiangyu Wang


While machines generally excel at physically-intensive tasks that require speed, strength, repetitive motions, and operation in hostile environments, humans are generally more cost-effective at mentally-intensive tasks that require judgment, sensing, and adaptability (Everett and Slocum 1994). Thus one vital role for automation is to augment rather than replace human capabilities. Mixed Reality (MR) technology can seamlessly delivers digitally based information to an individual within the operational context of their real world environment, thus making it a suitable solution for problems of degraded perception and cognition occurring in mentally-intensive tasks of appropriating information for decision-making.


Virtually all construction activities require performance of some mental tasks (information seeking, assessment, and decision-making), which may also be embedded into a larger physically-intensive task.


MR systems may be regarded as a type of machine interface to a digital environment or to digital information, which means that the theory in human-machine interfaces applies to the research of human-MR system interfaces. 

The real consideration here is that introducing an MR system involves presenting a user with a new information medium and tool that, if not properly designed, can be more of a burden than a help. Therefore, the actual impact on how humans obtain and function with information should be understood and addressed. The design of the MR system should exploit perception and cognition abilities without hampering the physical response action for performing the real world task. Therefore, the perceptual and cognitive issues are explored here with regard to major MR system technological components — media representation, input mechanism, output mechanism, and position/orientation tracker.


These four influencing factors are task mental requirements, working environment, physical disposition, and hands occupation, and each of these can influence the feasibility and usability of the four MR technological components (media representation, input mechanism, output mechanism, and tracking technology).


Most MR research applications are prototypes that were implemented for special applications, however, MR applications must be flexibly designed, in order to enable easy adaptation to different tasks. More research needs to be implemented to address flexibility issues of MR systems. To be cost effective, sustainable, and popularized, MR system must be designed to be flexible enough to be transferable from project to project or among different levels of tasks. It is envisioned that the developed AEC task taxonomy can be the starting point for formulating fundamental propositions regarding flexibility, extendibility, and popularity of MR systems.


# Augmented Reality Techniques for design and revitalisation in existing build environments
#### Dirk Donath, Jakob Beetz, Klaus Grether, Frank Petzold, Hartmut Seichter

The purpose of the project is the conceptional design of a computer-aided system for the capture, management and efficient integration of different types of data and to make these available in a flexible form for later planning tasks.

Central to a successful realisation of a project is an effective communication between the different professional disciplines. Different representations of the building model have to be made available to the different parties. Changes that are effected by the specialist have a mutual impact on the whole model. The interdependent nature of this process requires a well-conceived, flexible data model.


The surveyor sees the existing data in a seethrough overlay. Using geodetic input devices, manual measurement and correction, the actual survey results can be superimposed on the existing model, and the existing virtual model can therefore be ‘synchronised’ with the real-world situation. The surveyor works with a synthesis of measuring instrument and input device/user interface for the virtual model: the tachymeter measures distance, the same system allows vertices, edges and faces in the virtual model to be moved to match the live picture.

The captured data is constantly being checked against the real situation by overlaying the captured model with the image-data from a camera. By doing so, the surveyor is able to verify the developing virtual model on-site. Corrections can be applied immediately.

An efficient data and information exchange requires the setting up of a unified communication and cooperation platform. The quick commented 3D-sketch is still a frequently used means of communication between professionals, but is difficult to communicate and understand these sketches in computer form as intuitively as the pen-andpaper counterpart. The provision of context-sensitive sketches made possible via VR/AR (for instance overlaid on real world three-dimensional situations on-site) could represent a major improvement in communications between spatially separated planning participants.

AR offers the possibility of combining several tasks in one (different measuring techniques, digitising, mass and volume calculation and transfer to a facility management system) and to integrate separate organisational steps (survey, transfer to CAD, planning, structural calculation, etc.). Through the effective preparation and transfer of information it reduces time delays in information transfer and connects and collects relevant information at the salient point. Work can continue uninterrupted and data management and transfer can be achieved from begin through to the building in operation. An optimised provision of different information helps reduce planning costs as well as follow-on costs in facilities management and improves the smooth transfer of information.


#  Applying augmented reality for data interaction and collaboration in BIM
#### Ning GU, Vishal Singh and Xiangyu Wang

It is argued that visualisation can enhance the motivation for BIM-based collaboration through integration of advanced visualisation techniques such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). An AR interface for a BIM server is also presented and discussed in the paper. AR can open up potential opportunities for exploring alternatives to data representation, organisation and interaction, supporting seamless collaboration in BIM.


This paper discusses an integration framework adopting augmented reality (AR) as the primary interface for a BIM server. This represents a novel approach for data interaction and collaboration in BIM. AR enables a design environment where the digital information generated by a computer is inserted into the user’s view of a real-world scene. 

Several attempts have been made to address this issue by implementing knowledge integration and sharing between disciplines in AR-based environments. These applications can allow multiple disciplines to contribute and interact with the digital building information in a seamless and intuitive manner during design collaboration.


3D Model viewers supported or provided by BIM servers should have high data compression capabilities while maintaining the visual quality. It will be useful to provide technical features that allow instant, online mark-ups and tags on a shared document or model being by multiple users during the review.

Among the list of these technical requirements, the core is the enhanced support for inter-disciplinary building data representation, organisation and interaction. We propose the following integration framework for interfacing BIM servers using AR. AR enables a mixed reality design environment that supports both face-to-face and distant collaborations. In an AR environment, building information can be generated and represented as 3D virtual models; the models can then be viewed and interacted virtually, or extracted and inserted into the multi-disciplinary users’ views of a real-world scene. With TUI, AR can also support tangible interactions with digital building information beyond the use of the computer screen, mouse and keyboard, to allow more intuitive interactions such as gestures and body movements that are commonly used in traditional collaboration scenarios. The coupling of BIM and AR can open up potential opportunities for exploring alternative approaches to data representation, organisation and interaction for supporting seamless collaboration in a BIM server.


A BIM server supports multi-disciplinary collaboration by providing a platform for direct integration, storage and exchange of information from all payers involved in a building project. A BIM server is a collaboration platform that maintains a repository of the building information, and supports the viewing, checking, updating and modifying of both the geometric and nongeometric data.


This paper emphasises the increased signifi cance of realistic, accurate and intuitive visualisation for enhancing BIM-based collaboration across the different design and non-design disciplines in the AEC industry. The paper suggests that AR concepts technologies and techniques can be integrated with a BIM server to enhance visual communication and information exchange.

Such a framework is proposed (1) to support a wide range of activities that occur during building project collaboration including the accurate, secure and fl exible viewing, validating, and modifying of building information, and (2) to facilitate different levels of collaborations within a building project, through an intuitive interface for intra and inter-disciplinary collaboration.

In addition, construction methods and processes are customized in individual situations, taking accounts of factors such as site conditions, form, and program of the buildings. Furthermore, construction processes involve various tasks with a different level of detail, all of them require accuracy in execution.
	
Construction field has not been fully developed in terms of ICT / IoT usage in the current situation (Manyika 2015). In emerging markets, the construction industry has been expanding (IHS Global Construction Outlook 2015). Thus it requires accurate work of semi-skilled workers and effective logistics in construction using ICT. On the other hand, in developed countries, the reducing number of workable labor and the diminishing techniques in construction field are problematic issues.

ICT in a design field, such as building information modeling (BIM), facilitates the design of complex form of architectures. DC connects these to construction can ensure construction accuracy for ‘non-box’ types of architecture, as well as reduce costs.

Also there are techniques that can be applied for converting information from physical environment to digital data. By acquiring information such as three dimensional shape, type of parts and construction condition. These technologies include the following; 3D scanning with laser rangefinder or photogrammetry, position tracking (Wi-Fi / Bluetooth), target marker by image processing, RFID, UAV

In each process of construction, data conversion is necessary for each purpose. Yet, the certainty of data conversion is not guaranteed, and data conversion is often not reversible. Above that, data cannot be circulated for design communication. Finally, despite that information is necessary to continue to update as the physical situation changes, there is no platform that can integrate all information for construction.

There are two potential methods to synchronize between digital and physical model. One is scanning, to get the most recent status of the physical object. But this method need to detect location (three dimensional coordination) or afterprocess to dismantle mass to parts. The advantage of detect location is an ability to detect parts position and individual identification simultaneously, yet it is difficult. Other is assuming the state of the physical building by logging the sequential process. ‘Logging’ method does not need a location detection, so that just for chasing parts AR marker detection and RFID are used in here.
