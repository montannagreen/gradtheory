# Cloud Computing - Concepts, Architecture and Challenges
#### Yashpalsinh Jadeja, Kitrit Modi

Designed as a computing environment where computing needs by one party can be outsources to another party and when need be, arise to use the computing power or resources like database or emails, they can access them via internet. 

Moves computing and data away from desktop and portable PCs into large data centres.

Advantage of cloud computing is that customers do not have to pay for infrasturure, its installation, required man power to handle such infrastucture and maintenance. 

Cloud computing deals with computation, software, data acess and software services that may not require end-user knowledge of the physical location and the configuration of the system that is delivering the services.

Main goal of cloud computing is to make a better use of distributed resources, combine them to achieve higher throughput and be able to solve large scale computation problems. Cloud computing deals with virtualisation, scalability, interoperability, quality of service and the delivery models of the cloud, namely private, public and hybrid. 

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing 
Users access the data, applications or any other services with the help of a browser regardless of the device used and the user's location. 
Less IT skills are required for implementation 
Sharing of resources and costs amongst a large collection of users allows efficient utilization of the infrastructure.
Maintenance is easier in case of cloud computing applications as they need not to be installed on each users computer.

### Architecture
Divided into two sections: front end and back end.
Front end is what the client (user) sees whereas the back end is the cloud of the system. 
Front end has the clinets computer and the application required to access the cloud and the back has the cloud computing services like various computers, servers and data storage. 

### Advantages
The maintenance of the infrastructure, be it hardware or software is simplified, thus, less headaches for the IT team. Also applications that are quite storage extensive are more easier to use in the cloud environment compared to the same when used by the organization by its own. Also at the user level, what you mostly need is a simple web browser with internet connectivity.

### Disadvantages
The biggest concerns about cloud computing are security and privacy.
One way to solve this issue is the use of proper authentication techniques. Another solution is to provide with an authorization - so that each user can access only the data and applications relevant to his or her job.
Reliability is an issue. Servers in the cloud can have the same problems as the organization's resident servers. Downtimes can occur with cloud servers too.


# Cloud Computing: Issues and Challenges
#### Tharam Dillon, Chen Wu and Elizabeth Chang
### Definition
U.S. NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) appears to include key common elements widely used in the Cloud Computing community: Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, ondemand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

In particular, five essential elements of cloud computing are clearly articulated:

On-demand self-service: A consumer with an instantaneous need at a particular timeslot can avail computing resources (such as CPU time, network storage, software use, and so forth) in an automatic (i.e. convenient, self-serve) fashion without resorting to human interactions with providers of these resources.

Broad network access: These computing resources are delivered over the network (e.g. Internet) and used by various client applications with heterogeneous platforms (such as mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs) situated at a consumer's site.

Resource pooling. A cloud service providerâ€™s computing resources are 'pooled' together in an effort to serve multiple consumers using either the multi-tenancy or the virtualization model, "with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand" [1]. The motivation for setting up such a pool-based computing paradigm lies in two important factors: economies of scale and specialization. The result of a pool-based model is that physical computing resources become 'invisible' to consumers, who in general do not have control or knowledge over the location, formation, and originalities of these resources (e.g. database, CPU, etc.) . For example, consumers are not able to tell where their data is going to be stored in the Cloud.

Rapid elasticity. For consumers, computing resources become immediate rather than persistent: there are no up-front commitment and contract as they can use them to scale up whenever they want, and release them once they finish to scale down. Moreover, resources provisioning appears to be infinite to them, the consumption can rapidly rise in order to meet peak requirement at any time.

Measured Service. Although computing resources are pooled and shared by multiple consumers (i.e. multi-tenancy), the cloud infrastructure is able to use appropriate mechanisms to measure the usage of these resources for each individual consumer through its metering capabilities.


### Service Model

Software as a Service (Saas). - cloud consumers release their applications on a hosting environment, which can be accessed through networks from various clients by application users. Cloud consumers do not have control over the cloud infrasturcture that ofetn employs a multi-tenancy system architecture, nameling, different cloud consumers applicationsare organised in a single logical enviornment on the SaaS cloud.

Platform as a Service (PaaS). is a development platform suppirting the full 'software lifecyle' which allows cloud consumers o develop cloud services and applications direections onto the Paas cloud. Holds both developing and developed applications.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). -Cloud consumers directly use IT infrasturtures (processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources) provided in the IaaS cloud. Virtualisation is extensively used in IaaS cloud in order to integrate/decompose physical resources in an as-hoc manner to meet growing or shrinking resource demand from sloud consumers.

Data as a Service (Daas). The delivery of virtualized storage on demand becomes a seperate Cloud service - data storafe service. DaaS allows consumers to pay for what they are actualling sig rather than the site license for the entire database.
